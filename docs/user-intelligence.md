# User Intelligence Memory

OpenClaw's User Intelligence system tracks habits, preferences, and behavioral patterns to provide a more personalized and proactive experience.

## Categories

- **Habit**: Recurring actions or routines (e.g., "checks email every morning").
- **Preference**: Explicit or inferred likes/dislikes (e.g., "prefers concise reports").
- **Workflow**: Specific ways of working or sequences of tasks.
- **Schedule Pattern**: Patterns in when you are active or when tasks occur.
- **Interest**: Topics or areas you frequently discuss.

## Extraction

Intelligence is automatically extracted from your conversations with the agent. The system identifies recurring signals and updates confidence scores based on repetition.

## Proactive Actions

The agent uses this intelligence to:
- **Auto-schedule tasks**: e.g., generating a summary at a time you usually start working.
- **Adjust response style**: matching your preference for conciseness or detail.
- **Suggest automations**: identifying repetitive tasks that could be handled by a sub-agent.

## Management

You can view, edit, or delete detected intelligence entries in the **Mission Control** dashboard.
